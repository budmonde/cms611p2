# Doggo - Unity2D Game

This Project was my second video game project I worked on for the course [*CMS.611: Creating Video Games*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/comparative-media-studies-writing/cms-611j-creating-video-games-fall-2014/index.htm) in Spring 2017. The video game is a two-player top-down multitasking game where the two plaers are tasked to take care of a petkeeping store.

#### Team members:
- Audrey Li
- Karen Fan
- Monde Duinkharjav (budmonde)
- Rhea Lin (rhealin)
- Yolanda Zhou (yolandaz)

## Course Assignment Requirements

**Goals:** Create a two-player digital game in a short time frame. Practice project management with a larger team and choose prototyping methods appropriate for game design. Projects are allowed (but are not required) to involve one additional technical challenge: 3D, networking, or mobile devices.

**Development schedule:** 3 weeks of fast prototyping

**Requirements:**
- Meets themed constraint: Asymmetry
  - Two players perform different roles or strategies. Each player must face a different set of meaningful decisions to accomplish success. The game can be competitive or cooperative.
- Maximum play length: 5 minutes
- Two players only.
- Teams may choose one (and only one) technical challenge to explore: 3D, networking, or mobile devices. Teams may choose not to implement any of these technical challenges at any point during the assignment, preferably as early as possible.
- User Interface tested for legibility and usability. Significant attention played to entire user experience, as evidenced through iterative changes in design.
- Game must use & play audio for the player.
- Players can pick up & start playing the game with no external instructions.
- Game must be delivered as one of the following. No other software or plug-ins should be required.
  - A browser game to be run on Chrome.
  - A standalone *Windows* and *Mac OS X* executable packaged as ZIP archives.
  - A mobile game to be run on *Android* packaged as an APK file.

## Personal Notes

This project was arguably my second attempt at using [*Unity*](https://unity3d.com/) to make a video game (likely same for my teammates). My first project linked [here] (https://github.com/budmonde/magescape) was mostly an exercise on learning the *Unity Engine*. Working on this project has been a great experience in retrospect (although the proces itself was a complete disaster). Hopefully I can update this README with my latest video game project as a point of reference to how I started off -- maybe could be a useful guide for beginning game developers to see that everybody starts off sucking(?). (This all would only sound cool and inspirational on the pretense that I do follow up and make a worthwhile video game... otherwise this repository is like super depressing >~<) PS. I'm not actually a serious game developer -- just something I found mildly interesting, please do not find this rambling to be discouraging lol.

**UPDATE:** Here's the repository to the final project for this course: [In Memoriam](https://github.com/budmonde/inmemoriam).

## Acknowledgements

The game was built using [*Unity 5.3*](https://unity3d.com/) with *C#* used for scripting. All graphic art assets were made by the teammembers (Karen Fan, Rhea Lin, Yolanda Zhou) using *Adobe Illustrator* and sound assets were used from an open source sound file repository http://freesound.org. In the making of the game we referenced our project structure and design from the [*Unity Roguelike Youtube tutorial*](https://youtu.be/Fdcnt2-Jf4w?list=PLX2vGYjWbI0SKsNH5Rkpxvxr1dPE0Lw8F) series released by the *Unity* dev team. This project source code is licensed under the *MIT License*.
